# top-landing-page

This repository is my first legitimate venture into learning and using Git and GitHub, and is meant to showcase my first time managing a small project with these tools. While the landing page was built from scratch, pay closer attention to the git commit messages and how I've used GitHub, as that wa the primary goal of the project.
